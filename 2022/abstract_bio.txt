Title:
Hey... itâ€™s a PDF. What can go wrong?

Abstract:
The basic idea of a PDF is simple. Users can open a document on different operating systems, and it has the same appearance as its printed equivalent. In the early 1990s, this conformance was a game-changer: it allowed sharing of documents on the Internet. Since then, PDFs have experienced an incredible evolution. The latest PDF standard supports calculation logic, 3D animations, and the filling and submitting of forms. PDF nowadays even supports JavaScript, a well-known scripting language used on websites. PDFs can also be signed and encrypted to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity.
This talk sheds light on what can go wrong when a user opens a PDF. We present the art of breaking PDF signatures. We highlight the developers' contradictive interpretation of specifications and talk about the difficulties to validate PDF signatures properly. Finally, we conclude with an outlook of further threats raised from documents.
